Hey thanks for using this very simple but usefull tool.
first you need to copy all these 3 files to your root directory "/root/"

1. to start hacking type "./wifi-h-full.sh"

2. when the first screnn pops up wait for cca 20 min then press "CTRL + C"

3. pick the number of the wifi you want to hack and type it into the console

4. wait for the system to crack the password

5. IT IS THAT EASY
